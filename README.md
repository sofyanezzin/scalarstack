## Usage

Once installed, you can start using ScalarStack in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to create a scalar field and analyze its properties:

```python
from scalarstack import ScalarField

# Create a scalar field
field = ScalarField(dimensions=3)

# Set some properties
field.set_property('amplitude', 5)
field.set_property('frequency', 2)

# Analyze the field
field.analyze()
```
